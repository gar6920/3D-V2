# Game Design Document: Basic 3D Exploration Game

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the design for a simple, single-player 3D exploration game developed using Three.js. Players can move around freely in a basic 3D environment from a first-person perspective. The game has no specific objectives at this stage, focusing on foundational mechanics and environment setup.

## 2. Game Concept
The game is a minimalist 3D exploration experience where the player navigates a flat world populated with simple objects. It serves as a starting point for potential future expansions, keeping the initial design very basic.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics
- **Controls:**
  - **Movement:** WASD keys
    - W: Move forward
    - A: Strafe left
    - S: Move backward
    - D: Strafe right
  - **Camera:** Mouse movement to look around (yaw and pitch)
- **Collision Detection:**
  - Simple bounding box checks to prevent the player from passing through objects.

## 4. Environment
- **Ground:**
  - A large, flat plane (e.g., 100x100 units) colored green to represent grass.
- **Objects:**
  - 10 cubes, each 1x1x1 unit, placed at random positions on the ground with varying solid colors (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
- **Lighting:**
  - One directional light to simulate sunlight.
  - One ambient light for even illumination.

## 5. Technical Specifications
- **Engine:** Three.js
- **Camera:** PerspectiveCamera positioned at a fixed height (e.g., 1.5 units) for a first-person view.
- **Renderer:** WebGLRenderer, sized to the browser window.
- **Input Handling:**
  - Keyboard events for movement.
  - Mouse events for camera rotation.
- **Collision Detection:** 2D bounding box checks in the x-z plane (y-axis fixed).
- **Animation Loop:** Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for continuous updates and rendering.

## 6. Art Style
- Basic geometric shapes with solid colors.
- No textures, shadows, or complex materials.

## 7. User Interface
- A simple HTML overlay with text: *"Use WASD to move, mouse to look around."*

## 8. Sound
- None included in this basic version.

## 9. Performance
- Optimized for lightweight performance with a minimal number of objects and no advanced effects.

## 10. Platform
- Web-based, designed to run in desktop browsers.

## 11. Multiplayer
- Single-player only.
