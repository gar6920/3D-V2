Game Design Document: Basic 3D Exploration Game
1. Overview
This document outlines the design for a simple, single-player 3D exploration game developed using Three.js. Players can freely navigate a basic 3D environment, switching between first-person and third-person perspectives. The game includes a minimap for spatial awareness and a visible player character to enhance immersion. At this stage, there are no specific objectives, with the focus remaining on foundational mechanics and environment setup.
2. Game Concept
The game is a minimalist 3D exploration experience where players traverse a flat world populated with simple objects. The addition of a visible player character, a toggleable third-person view, and a minimap enriches the exploration aspect, providing a clearer sense of the player's position and surroundings. This design serves as a foundation for potential future expansions while keeping the core experience straightforward.
3. Gameplay Mechanics
Controls:
Movement: WASD keys
W: Move forward

A: Strafe left

S: Move backward

D: Strafe right

Camera:
Mouse movement to look around:
In first-person: Controls yaw and pitch.

In third-person: Rotates the camera around the player character.

View Toggle: Press 'V' to switch between first-person and third-person views.

Minimap:
A small, top-down view of the game world displayed in the corner of the screen.

Shows the player's position and nearby objects to aid navigation.

Collision Detection:
Simple bounding box checks to prevent the player from passing through objects.

4. Environment
Ground:
A large, flat plane (e.g., 100x100 units) colored green to represent grass.

Objects:
10 cubes, each 1x1x1 unit, placed at random positions on the ground with varying solid colors (e.g., red, blue, yellow).

Player Character:
A simple geometric shape (e.g., a cube or sphere) representing the player.

Positioned at the camera's location in first-person view.

Visible on-screen in third-person view.

Lighting:
One directional light to simulate sunlight.

One ambient light for even illumination.

5. Technical Specifications
Engine: Three.js

Camera:
PerspectiveCamera with adjustable positioning:
First-person: Attached to the player character at eye level (e.g., 1.5 units high).

Third-person: Positioned behind and above the player character, following its movement and rotating based on mouse input.

Renderer: WebGLRenderer, sized to the browser window.

Input Handling:
Keyboard events for movement and view toggling.

Mouse events for camera rotation.

Collision Detection: 2D bounding box checks in the x-z plane (y-axis fixed).

Minimap:
Implemented using a 2D canvas element.

Renders a top-down view of the game world, updating in real-time to reflect player and object positions.

Animation Loop: Uses requestAnimationFrame for continuous updates and rendering.

6. Art Style
Basic geometric shapes with solid colors for all objects, including the player character.

No textures, shadows, or complex materials to maintain a minimalist aesthetic.

7. User Interface
A simple HTML overlay with text: "Use WASD to move, mouse to look around. Press 'V' to toggle view."

A minimap displayed in the corner of the screen, providing a top-down view of the game world.

8. Sound
None included in this basic version.

9. Performance
Optimized for lightweight performance with a minimal number of objects and no advanced effects.

10. Platform
Web-based, designed to run in desktop browsers.

11. Multiplayer
Single-player only.
