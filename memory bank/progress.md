# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure - COMPLETED
- Created the basic project directory structure:
  - Root directory with index.html
  - css/ directory with styles.css for UI styling
  - js/ directory with modular JavaScript files:
    - main.js: Entry point and game loop
    - scene.js: Three.js scene setup
    - controls.js: Player input handling
    - collision.js: Collision detection
    - utils.js: Constants and utility functions
  - assets/ directory for future expansion
- Set up proper ES6 module system with import/export statements
- Linked Three.js using a CDN
- Created a responsive canvas and basic UI instruction text

All files are properly connected and ready for further implementation. The modules have placeholder functions that will be built upon in subsequent steps.

## Step 2: Set Up the HTML and Basic Three.js Renderer - COMPLETED
- Updated index.html to use an ES6 import map for Three.js instead of a global script tag
- Modified JavaScript files to properly import Three.js as a module
- Initialized a WebGLRenderer with anti-aliasing and attached it to the canvas
- Set the renderer's clear color to sky blue (0x87CEEB)
- Created window resize handler to maintain proper aspect ratio
- Set up a local development server (http-server) to serve files and avoid CORS issues
- Fixed issues with ES6 module loading by properly importing Three.js in all relevant files

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene, camera, and renderer are properly set up and await further implementation.

Status: Ready for Step 3 implementation.

## Step 3: Create the Scene and Camera - COMPLETED
- Created a new Three.js scene in scene.js
- Set up PerspectiveCamera with correct parameters:
  - Field of view: 75 degrees
  - Aspect ratio: Window width / height
  - Near clipping plane: 0.1
  - Far clipping plane: 1000
- Positioned camera at (0, 1.5, 0) for first-person view
- Properly exported scene and camera for use in other modules
- Successfully integrated camera and scene in main.js game loop
- Verified rendering works with sky blue background

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene and camera are properly set up with correct parameters and positioning. The game loop is running smoothly, ready for adding objects and lighting in the next steps.

Status: Ready for Step 4 implementation.
