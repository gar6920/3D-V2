# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure - COMPLETED
- Created the basic project directory structure:
  - Root directory with index.html
  - css/ directory with styles.css for UI styling
  - js/ directory with modular JavaScript files:
    - main.js: Entry point and game loop
    - scene.js: Three.js scene setup
    - controls.js: Player input handling
    - collision.js: Collision detection
    - utils.js: Constants and utility functions
  - assets/ directory for future expansion
- Set up proper ES6 module system with import/export statements
- Linked Three.js using a CDN
- Created a responsive canvas and basic UI instruction text

All files are properly connected and ready for further implementation. The modules have placeholder functions that will be built upon in subsequent steps.

## Step 2: Set Up the HTML and Basic Three.js Renderer - COMPLETED
- Updated index.html to use an ES6 import map for Three.js instead of a global script tag
- Modified JavaScript files to properly import Three.js as a module
- Initialized a WebGLRenderer with anti-aliasing and attached it to the canvas
- Set the renderer's clear color to sky blue (0x87CEEB)
- Created window resize handler to maintain proper aspect ratio
- Set up a local development server (http-server) to serve files and avoid CORS issues
- Fixed issues with ES6 module loading by properly importing Three.js in all relevant files

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene, camera, and renderer are properly set up and await further implementation.

Status: Ready for Step 3 implementation.

## Step 3: Create the Scene and Camera - COMPLETED
- Created a new Three.js scene in scene.js
- Set up PerspectiveCamera with correct parameters:
  - Field of view: 75 degrees
  - Aspect ratio: Window width / height
  - Near clipping plane: 0.1
  - Far clipping plane: 1000
- Positioned camera at (0, 1.5, 0) for first-person view
- Properly exported scene and camera for use in other modules
- Successfully integrated camera and scene in main.js game loop
- Verified rendering works with sky blue background

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene and camera are properly set up with correct parameters and positioning. The game loop is running smoothly, ready for adding objects and lighting in the next steps.

Status: Ready for Step 4 implementation.

## Step 4: Add Lighting - COMPLETED
- Added directional light to simulate sunlight:
  - Position: (5, 10, 7)
  - Intensity: 1.0
  - Color: white (0xffffff)
- Added ambient light for even illumination:
  - Intensity: 0.2
  - Color: white (0xffffff)
- Properly exported lights for use in other modules
- Successfully integrated lights into the scene
- Verified scene renders correctly with lighting system in place

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene, camera, and lighting are properly set up with correct parameters and positioning. The lighting system is ready for illuminating objects that will be added in the next steps.

Status: Ready for Step 5 implementation.

## Step 5: Create the Ground Plane - COMPLETED
- Created a plane geometry (100x100 units) using THREE.PlaneGeometry
- Applied MeshStandardMaterial with green color (0x00ff00) to simulate grass
- Positioned the plane at y=0 and rotated -90 degrees around X-axis
- Added ground plane to the scene
- Successfully integrated with existing lighting system
- Verified ground plane renders correctly with proper lighting

Current state: The application now shows a large green ground plane that extends 100 units in each direction, properly lit by the directional and ambient lights. The scene is ready for adding additional objects (cubes) in the next step.

Status: Ready for Step 6 implementation.

## Step 6: Add Initial Cubes - COMPLETED
- Created a `createCube` function in scene.js that generates cubes with specified:
  - Position (x, y, z)
  - Size
  - Color
- Added initial set of cubes to create an interesting environment:
  - Row of three 1x1 unit cubes at z=-10:
    - Red cube at x=-5
    - Blue cube at x=0
    - Purple cube at x=5
  - Two scattered 1x1 unit cubes at z=-15:
    - Yellow cube at x=-3
    - Cyan cube at x=3
  - One larger 2x2 unit gray cube at z=-20 as an obstacle
- All cubes are properly positioned on the ground plane (y coordinate is half their height)
- Cubes are tracked in an array for future collision detection
- Verified that all cubes render correctly with proper lighting and shadows

Current state: The scene now contains multiple colorful cubes at different positions and distances, creating an interesting environment for the player to navigate around. The cubes are properly lit and cast shadows, providing depth to the scene.

Status: Ready for Step 7 implementation.

## Step 7: Implement Player Movement - COMPLETED
- Implemented updateControls() function in controls.js for player movement
- Added camera rotation handling using 'YXZ' order for proper FPS-style rotation
- Implemented directional movement (WASD keys) relative to camera facing direction:
  - W: Move forward in direction of camera
  - S: Move backward opposite to camera direction
  - A: Strafe left relative to camera
  - D: Strafe right relative to camera
- Added movement vector normalization for consistent speed in all directions
- Applied MOVEMENT_SPEED constant (0.1 units per frame) for smooth motion
- Maintained camera height during movement (y position stays constant)
- Integrated with existing mouse look controls:
  - Mouse movement controls camera rotation
  - Pitch is limited to prevent camera flipping
  - Pointer lock is activated on click for proper FPS controls

Current state: The player can now move around the scene using WASD keys and look around using the mouse. Movement is smooth and consistent in all directions, properly aligned with the camera's view direction. The scene maintains proper perspective and the controls feel responsive and natural.

Status: Ready for Step 8 implementation after movement testing validation.
