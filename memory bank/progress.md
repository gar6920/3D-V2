# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure - COMPLETED
- Created the basic project directory structure:
  - Root directory with index.html
  - css/ directory with styles.css for UI styling
  - js/ directory with modular JavaScript files:
    - main.js: Entry point and game loop
    - scene.js: Three.js scene setup
    - controls.js: Player input handling
    - collision.js: Collision detection
    - utils.js: Constants and utility functions
  - assets/ directory for future expansion
- Set up proper ES6 module system with import/export statements
- Linked Three.js using a CDN
- Created a responsive canvas and basic UI instruction text

All files are properly connected and ready for further implementation. The modules have placeholder functions that will be built upon in subsequent steps.

## Step 2: Set Up the HTML and Basic Three.js Renderer - COMPLETED
- Updated index.html to use an ES6 import map for Three.js instead of a global script tag
- Modified JavaScript files to properly import Three.js as a module
- Initialized a WebGLRenderer with anti-aliasing and attached it to the canvas
- Set the renderer's clear color to sky blue (0x87CEEB)
- Created window resize handler to maintain proper aspect ratio
- Set up a local development server (http-server) to serve files and avoid CORS issues
- Fixed issues with ES6 module loading by properly importing Three.js in all relevant files

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene, camera, and renderer are properly set up and await further implementation.

Status: Ready for Step 3 implementation.

## Step 3: Create the Scene and Camera - COMPLETED
- Created a new Three.js scene in scene.js
- Set up PerspectiveCamera with correct parameters:
  - Field of view: 75 degrees
  - Aspect ratio: Window width / height
  - Near clipping plane: 0.1
  - Far clipping plane: 1000
- Positioned camera at (0, 1.5, 0) for first-person view
- Properly exported scene and camera for use in other modules
- Successfully integrated camera and scene in main.js game loop
- Verified rendering works with sky blue background

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene and camera are properly set up with correct parameters and positioning. The game loop is running smoothly, ready for adding objects and lighting in the next steps.

Status: Ready for Step 4 implementation.

## Step 4: Add Lighting - COMPLETED
- Added directional light to simulate sunlight:
  - Position: (5, 10, 7)
  - Intensity: 1.0
  - Color: white (0xffffff)
- Added ambient light for even illumination:
  - Intensity: 0.2

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene, camera, and lighting are properly set up with correct parameters and positioning. The lighting system is ready for illuminating objects that will be added in the next steps.

Status: Ready for Step 5 implementation.

## Step 5: Create the Ground Plane - COMPLETED
- Created a plane geometry (100x100 units) using THREE.PlaneGeometry
- Applied MeshStandardMaterial with green color (0x00ff00) to simulate grass
- Positioned the plane at y=0 and rotated -90 degrees around X-axis
- Added ground plane to the scene
- Successfully integrated with existing lighting system
- Verified ground plane renders correctly with proper lighting

Current state: The application now shows a large green ground plane that extends 100 units in each direction, properly lit by the directional and ambient lights. The scene is ready for adding additional objects (cubes) in the next step.

Status: Ready for Step 6 implementation.

## Step 6: Add Initial Cubes - COMPLETED
- Created a `createCube` function in scene.js that generates cubes with specified:
  - Position (x, y, z)
  - Size
  - Color
- Added initial set of cubes to create an interesting environment:
  - Row of three 1x1 unit cubes at z=-10:
    - Red cube at x=-5
    - Blue cube at x=0
    - Purple cube at x=5
  - Two scattered 1x1 unit cubes at z=-15:
    - Yellow cube at x=-3
    - Cyan cube at x=3
  - One larger 2x2 unit gray cube at z=-20 as an obstacle
- All cubes are properly positioned on the ground plane (y coordinate is half their height)
- Cubes are tracked in an array for future collision detection
- Verified that all cubes render correctly with proper lighting and shadows

Current state: The scene now contains multiple colorful cubes at different positions and distances, creating an interesting environment for the player to navigate around. The cubes are properly lit and cast shadows, providing depth to the scene.

Status: Ready for Step 7 implementation.

## Step 7: Implement Player Movement - COMPLETED
- Implemented updateControls() function in controls.js for player movement
- Added camera rotation handling using 'YXZ' order for proper FPS-style rotation
- Implemented directional movement (WASD keys) relative to camera facing direction:
  - W: Move forward in direction of camera
  - S: Move backward opposite to camera direction
  - A: Strafe left relative to camera
  - D: Strafe right relative to camera
- Added movement vector normalization for consistent speed in all directions
- Applied MOVEMENT_SPEED constant (0.1 units per frame) for smooth motion
- Maintained camera height during movement (y position stays constant)
- Integrated with existing mouse look controls:
  - Mouse movement controls camera rotation
  - Pitch is limited to prevent camera flipping
  - Pointer lock is activated on click for proper FPS controls

Current state: The player can now move around the scene using WASD keys and look around using the mouse. Movement is smooth and consistent in all directions, properly aligned with the camera's view direction. The scene maintains proper perspective and the controls feel responsive and natural.

Status: Ready for Step 8 implementation after movement testing validation.

## Step 8: Implement Mouse Look - COMPLETED
- Enhanced mouse look controls with proper pointer lock implementation
- Added mouse sensitivity control (MOUSE_SENSITIVITY constant)
- Implemented proper event cleanup with cleanupControls()
- Added cross-browser support for mouse movement events
- Limited pitch rotation to prevent camera flipping (-89 to +89 degrees)
- Added error handling for browsers that don't support pointer lock
- Updated UI with clear instructions and smooth transitions:
  - Centered instruction overlay
  - Detailed control information
  - Smooth opacity transitions
  - Proper display/hide behavior based on pointer lock state
- Added ESC key handling to exit pointer lock mode
- Improved movement controls to only work when pointer is locked
- Verified all test cases:
  - Smooth camera rotation
  - Proper pitch limits
  - UI state management
  - Cross-browser compatibility

Current state: The game now has fully functional first-person controls with proper mouse look implementation. The UI provides clear instructions and smooth transitions between states. All edge cases are handled, including browser compatibility and error states.

Status: Ready for Step 9 implementation.

## Step 9: Implement Collision Detection - COMPLETED
- Implemented AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection system in collision.js:
  - Added constants for player collision box dimensions:
    - PLAYER_WIDTH: 0.5 units (for both width and depth)
    - PLAYER_HEIGHT: 1.8 units
  - Implemented checkCollisions function that:
    - Creates player AABB from camera position
    - Creates cube AABBs from their positions and sizes
    - Uses checkAABBCollision utility to test for intersections
    - Returns true if any collision is detected
- Modified controls.js to integrate collision detection:
  - Added import for checkCollisions function
  - Updated updateControls to handle collisions:
    - Stores previous position before movement
    - Applies movement
    - Checks for collisions
    - Reverts to previous position if collision occurs
- Verified collision system works:
  - Player cannot walk through cubes
  - Movement is blocked when colliding with objects
  - Collision detection works from all angles
  - Looking around still works when colliding
  - Movement in non-colliding directions still works

Current state: The game now has fully functional collision detection, preventing the player from walking through objects while maintaining smooth movement and camera controls. The implementation uses efficient AABB collision detection and properly integrates with the existing movement system.

Status: Ready for Step 10 implementation after validation.

## Step 10: Implement Third-Person View - COMPLETED
- Created player representation and camera management structure:
  - Added playerGroup as a parent object in scene.js
  - Created a simple red box as temporary player model
  - Reorganized camera to be a child of the playerGroup in first-person mode
  - Updated the collision detection to use playerGroup position
- Implemented view mode toggle ('V' key) in controls.js:
  - Added viewMode state variable ('firstPerson' or 'thirdPerson')
  - Created switchViewMode function to handle camera repositioning
  - In first-person mode, camera is a child of playerGroup at eye level
  - In third-person mode, camera is a scene child positioned behind/above player
- Enhanced third-person camera controls:
  - Added mouse wheel zoom functionality (using event.deltaY)
  - Implemented camera angle adjustment with mouse movement
  - Set reasonable min/max limits for camera distance and angles
  - Added smooth transitions between different camera positions
- Updated UI instructions to include new controls:
  - Added 'V - Toggle first-person/third-person view' to instructions
  - Added information about mouse wheel zoom and angle adjustments
- Modified collision and movement system to work with both view modes:
  - Movement direction always based on player rotation regardless of view
  - Collisions use playerGroup position instead of camera directly
  - Player model rotates to face movement direction
- Added helpful console logging for debugging camera positions and angles

Current state: The game now supports both first-person and third-person camera modes. Players can toggle between modes with the 'V' key, zoom in/out with the mouse wheel, and adjust the camera angle by moving the mouse up/down in third-person mode. The player is represented by a temporary red box model that is visible in third-person view. Movement and collision detection work correctly in both view modes.

Status: Ready for implementing the next feature (visible player character with more complex model).

## Feature 1: Adding a Visible Player Character - COMPLETED
- Implemented GLB model loading for the player character:
  - Added GLTFLoader to the import system
  - Created proper ES6 import maps in index.html to support addons
  - Implemented async loading with proper error handling
  - Added fallback to simple cube if model loading fails
- Enhanced the player model implementation:
  - Positioned model at correct height (0.75 units) to sit properly on ground
  - Set initial visibility to false for first-person mode
  - Added proper material properties (roughness, metalness)
  - Applied shadow settings to cast and receive shadows
  - Set model name to 'player' for easy identification
- Improved camera and model integration:
  - Positioned camera at eye level (1.5 units) at the top of model
  - Set proper camera rotation order ('YXZ') for FPS-style rotation
  - Ensured model is invisible in first-person view to prevent clipping
  - Made model visible in third-person view
- Enhanced shadow system:
  - Enabled shadow maps in the renderer (PCFSoftShadowMap)
  - Set up high-quality shadow settings for the directional light
  - Configured shadow camera parameters for better quality
  - Applied shadow properties to all objects (player, cubes, ground)
- Improved collision detection:
  - Updated collision box dimensions to match the player model exactly
  - Switched from "move-then-check" to "check-then-move" system
  - Made collision boxes more precise to prevent any overlap
  - Optimized collision detection to work properly in both view modes
- Fixed mouse controls:
  - Inverted Y-axis in third-person view only for better control
  - Removed debug console logs

Current state: The game now features a custom 3D model loaded from a GLB file as the player character. The model is properly integrated with the camera, shadows, and collision systems. Movement is smooth, and the model doesn't clip through or overlap with objects. The player character is invisible in first-person view and visible in third-person view. The third-person camera controls are more intuitive with inverted Y-axis.

Status: Ready for Feature 2 implementation.

## Feature 2: Implementing Globe-Like World Wrapping - COMPLETED

  - Added WORLD_BOUNDARY constant (50 units) in utils.js to define the wrapping points
  - Created a wrapPosition utility function to handle position wrapping logic
  - Modified player movement to wrap around when reaching world boundaries
  - Updated collision detection to handle objects at world edges
- Enhanced visual feedback for world wrapping:
  - Added boundary markers at the world edges for orientation
  - Used colored markers at the corners for directional awareness (red, green, blue, yellow)
  - Created visual duplicates of objects near boundaries to create seamless transitions
  - Implemented proper duplication for X-axis, Z-axis, and corner (diagonal) wrapping cases
- Improved collision detection for wrapped world:
  - Enhanced collision logic to detect collisions with wrapped objects
  - Added special handling for objects near world boundaries
  - Implemented proper collision detection for edge and corner cases
  - Created a checkWrappedCollision helper function for testing collisions with duplicated objects
- Verified functionality:
  - Player can seamlessly move across world boundaries in all directions
  - Objects are properly visible when approaching from either side of a boundary
  - Collision detection works correctly across world boundaries
  - Navigation maintains proper orientation during wrapping

Current state: The world now wraps around seamlessly in all directions, creating an infinite-feeling play area while maintaining a bounded size. The player can move continuously in any direction and will wrap around to the opposite side when reaching a boundary, with proper visual feedback and collision handling.

Status: Ready for the next feature implementation.

## Feature 3: Creating an Infinite Ground Effect - COMPLETED
- Enhanced the ground plane to create an infinite horizon effect:
  - Expanded ground plane from 100x100 to 1000x1000 units
  - Used a more natural green color (0x228822) for the ground
  - Added a subtle grid pattern for better distance perception and movement feedback
- Implemented atmospheric effects:
  - Added scene fog matching the sky color (0x87CEEB)
  - Configured fog to start at 50 units and become opaque at 300 units
  - Ensured fog color matches the sky for a seamless horizon
- Improved boundary markers for subtlety:
  - Reduced marker size and height
  - Made regular markers match the ground color
  - Increased spacing between markers
  - Added transparency for better blending with the environment
  - Maintained colored corner markers but made them more subtle
- Enhanced visual duplicates for objects near boundaries:
  - Made duplicate objects less transparent (0.9 opacity) for better visual consistency
  - Improved the createMirrorCube function for more natural appearance
  - Ensured duplicates match the visual style of original objects
- Maintained all wrapping functionality while improving visual presentation:
  - World still wraps around at boundaries
  - Visual experience suggests an infinite landscape
  - No visible edges where the player might "fall off"

Current state: The game world now has a much more immersive feel with the ground appearing to extend infinitely to the horizon. The grid pattern provides spatial awareness, while the fog creates a natural blend between ground and sky at the distance. The boundary markers are now subtle guides rather than obvious barriers, and the wrapping functionality remains fully intact.

Status: Ready for the next feature implementation.
