# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure - COMPLETED
- Created the basic project directory structure:
  - Root directory with index.html
  - css/ directory with styles.css for UI styling
  - js/ directory with modular JavaScript files:
    - main.js: Entry point and game loop
    - scene.js: Three.js scene setup
    - controls.js: Player input handling
    - collision.js: Collision detection
    - utils.js: Constants and utility functions
  - assets/ directory for future expansion
- Set up proper ES6 module system with import/export statements
- Linked Three.js using a CDN
- Created a responsive canvas and basic UI instruction text

All files are properly connected and ready for further implementation. The modules have placeholder functions that will be built upon in subsequent steps.

## Step 2: Set Up the HTML and Basic Three.js Renderer - COMPLETED
- Updated index.html to use an ES6 import map for Three.js instead of a global script tag
- Modified JavaScript files to properly import Three.js as a module
- Initialized a WebGLRenderer with anti-aliasing and attached it to the canvas
- Set the renderer's clear color to sky blue (0x87CEEB)
- Created window resize handler to maintain proper aspect ratio
- Set up a local development server (http-server) to serve files and avoid CORS issues
- Fixed issues with ES6 module loading by properly importing Three.js in all relevant files

Current state: The application shows a sky blue canvas that fills the browser window with instruction text at the top left. The scene, camera, and renderer are properly set up and await further implementation.

Status: Ready for Step 3 implementation.
