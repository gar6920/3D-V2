For your basic 3D exploration game built with Three.js, the tech stack consists of the following technologies:
HTML5: This is used to structure the web page and embed the game canvas where the 3D graphics will be displayed.

CSS3: This handles styling for user interface elements, such as instruction text overlays or any other visual components outside the 3D scene.

JavaScript (ES6): The core programming language for the game, where you'll write the logic for movement, camera controls, collision detection, and more. ES6 modules are utilized to keep the code organized in separate files (e.g., main.js, scene.js, controls.js, collision.js, utils.js) for better maintainability.

Three.js: A powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the creation and rendering of 3D graphics in the browser, managing essential components like the scene, camera, lighting, and objects.

WebGL: The underlying technology that Three.js uses to render the 3D graphics efficiently in the browser, leveraging hardware acceleration for smooth performance.

Local Development Server: Tools like Live Server or a Node.js server with Express are recommended to serve the game files during development. This ensures proper loading of assets and simulates a production-like environment, making the development process smoother with features like automatic browser reloading.

This tech stack leverages modern web standards, providing a robust foundation for your game while keeping it accessible across browsers and scalable for future enhancements.
