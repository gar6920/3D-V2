Detailed Implementation Plan for Basic 3D Exploration Game
This implementation plan provides step-by-step instructions for AI developers to build a basic 3D exploration game using Three.js. Each step is specific, includes actionable instructions, and comes with a test to verify correctness. The focus is on core game features, excluding advanced elements.
Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure
Instructions:
Create a new project directory.

Inside the directory, create these files:
index.html: The main HTML file.

main.js: The JavaScript entry point.

scene.js: For Three.js scene setup.

controls.js: For player input and movement.

collision.js: For collision detection logic.

utils.js: For utility functions and constants.

Link all JavaScript files using ES6 modules (import/export).

Test:
Open index.html in a browser and check the console. No errors related to file loading or module imports should appear.

Step 2: Set Up the HTML and Basic Three.js Renderer
Instructions:
In index.html, add a <canvas> element for rendering.

Add a script tag to load main.js as a module:
html

<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>

In main.js, import functions from other modules.

Initialize a Three.js WebGLRenderer, set its size to the browser window’s dimensions, and attach it to the <canvas>.

Test:
Open index.html in a browser. A black canvas should fill the window, with no console errors.

Step 3: Create the Scene and Camera
Instructions:
In scene.js, create a new Three.js scene.

Add a PerspectiveCamera with:
Field of view: 75 degrees.

Aspect ratio: Window width / height.

Near clipping plane: 0.1.

Far clipping plane: 1000.

Position the camera at (0, 1.5, 0) for a first-person view.

Export the scene and camera for use elsewhere.

Test:
In main.js, add the camera to the scene and render it. The canvas should remain black (no objects yet).

Step 4: Add Lighting
Instructions:
In scene.js, add a directional light (simulating sunlight):
Position: (5, 10, 7).

Intensity: 1.

Add an ambient light with intensity 0.2 for even illumination.

Add both lights to the scene.

Test:
Render the scene. The canvas should still be black (no objects to light up yet).

Step 5: Create the Ground Plane
Instructions:
In scene.js, create a plane geometry (100x100 units).

Apply a basic material with a green color (0x00ff00) for grass.

Position the plane at y=0 and add it to the scene.

Test:
Render the scene. A green plane should be visible. Adjust the camera if needed to confirm.

Step 6: Add Cubes to the Scene
Instructions:
In scene.js, create 10 cubes (1x1x1 units each).

Assign random positions on the ground:
x: -50 to 50.

z: -50 to 50.

y: 0.5 (half cube height).

Give each cube a unique solid color (e.g., 0xff0000 for red).

Add all cubes to the scene.

Test:
Render the scene. 10 colored cubes should appear scattered on the green plane.

Step 7: Implement Basic Movement Controls
Instructions:
In controls.js, add event listeners for WASD keys.

Track key states with variables (e.g., isWPressed).

In main.js, create a game loop to update the camera’s position based on pressed keys (speed: 0.1 units/frame).

Test:
Press W, A, S, D. The camera should move forward, left, backward, and right smoothly.

Step 8: Implement Mouse Look
Instructions:
In controls.js, add mouse movement event listeners.

Update camera rotation based on mouse input.

Limit pitch (up/down) to ±89 degrees to prevent flipping.

Test:
Move the mouse. The camera should rotate left/right and up/down without flipping.

Step 9: Implement Collision Detection
Instructions:
In collision.js, write a function for AABB collision checks (x-z plane) between the camera and cubes.

In main.js, check collisions in the game loop and block camera movement if a collision occurs.

Test:
Move toward a cube. The camera should stop upon contact, not passing through.

Step 10: Add User Interface Instructions
Instructions:
In index.html, add a <div>:
html

<div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; color: white;">Use WASD to move, mouse to look around.</div>

Style it for visibility.

Test:
Open the game. The instruction text should appear clearly on-screen.

Step 11: Optimize and Test Performance
Instructions:
Aim for 60 FPS; monitor frame rate.

Check for performance issues (e.g., excessive draw calls).

Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Test:
Use browser tools to verify FPS and memory usage. The game should run smoothly.

Step 12: Final Testing and Debugging
Instructions:
Playtest thoroughly to find bugs.

Verify WASD and mouse controls work.

Ensure collision detection blocks cube penetration.

Confirm all assets load correctly.

Test:
Play for several minutes, testing all interactions. Fix any issues.
