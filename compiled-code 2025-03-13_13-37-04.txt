# 3D Exploration Game Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of our 3D exploration game built with Three.js. The application follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns, using ES6 modules for organization.

## File Structure
```

├── css/
│   └── styles.css       # CSS styling for UI elements

│   └── utils.js         # Constants and utility functions
└── assets/              # Directory for future assets (textures, models, etc.)
```

## Module Responsibilities

### index.html
- Provides the HTML structure for the application
- Contains the canvas element where the 3D scene is rendered
- Includes UI elements like instruction text
- Uses ES6 import maps to properly import Three.js as a module
- Loads the main.js module to bootstrap the application

### main.js
- Application entry point
- Imports Three.js and other modules
- Initializes the Three.js WebGLRenderer with anti-aliasing
- Sets canvas size to match the window dimensions
- Sets up the game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Coordinates interactions between other modules
- Handles window resize events (maintaining proper aspect ratio)
- Manages high-level game state
- Sets the renderer's clear color to sky blue (0x87CEEB)

### scene.js
- Imports Three.js properly as an ES6 module
- Creates and manages the Three.js Scene object
- Sets up the camera with the specified parameters (FOV: 75, near: 0.1, far: 1000)
- Positions the camera at eye level (1.5 units high)
- Contains functions for creating and managing 3D objects
- Implements lighting system:
  - Directional light (sunlight simulation) at position (5, 10, 7)
  - Ambient light for even scene illumination
  - Both lights use white color (0xffffff)
  - Directional light intensity: 1.0
  - Ambient light intensity: 0.2
- Implements ground plane:
  - Uses PlaneGeometry (100x100 units)
  - MeshStandardMaterial with green color (0x00ff00)
  - Positioned at y=0 and rotated -90° on X-axis
  - Provides base for object placement and player movement
- Implements cube creation and management:
  - createCube function for generating parametric cubes
  - Parameters include position (x, y, z), size, and color
  - Uses BoxGeometry and MeshStandardMaterial
  - Maintains array of all created cubes for collision detection
  - Initial scene setup includes:
    - Row of three 1x1 colored cubes at z=-10
    - Two scattered 1x1 cubes at z=-15
    - One larger 2x2 gray obstacle cube at z=-20
- Exports scene objects, camera, lights, and cube management functions

### controls.js
- Imports Three.js and required modules
- Manages all user input (keyboard, mouse)
- Implements robust pointer lock system:
  - Handles pointer lock requests and state changes
  - Provides error handling for unsupported browsers
  - Shows/hides UI based on pointer lock state
  - Implements ESC key to exit pointer lock
- Tracks movement states (forward, backward, left, right)
- Implements advanced mouse look controls:
  - Configurable mouse sensitivity via MOUSE_SENSITIVITY constant
  - Cross-browser support for mouse movement events
  - Proper cleanup of event listeners
  - Smooth camera rotation with proper limits
- Updates camera rotation:
  - Uses 'YXZ' rotation order for proper FPS camera behavior
  - Implements yaw (left/right) rotation
  - Implements pitch (up/down) with -89° to +89° limits
  - Prevents camera flipping at extreme angles
- Handles movement:
  - Only processes movement when pointer is locked
  - Calculates movement direction based on camera rotation
  - Normalizes movement vector for consistent speed
  - Applies MOVEMENT_SPEED constant for smooth motion
  - Updates camera position while maintaining height
  - Movement is relative to camera facing direction
  - WASD keys move in the corresponding view-relative directions

### collision.js
- Imports Three.js and required modules (camera and cubes from scene.js)
- Implements AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection system:
  - Defines player collision box dimensions (width: 0.5, height: 1.8)
  - Creates player AABB based on camera position
  - Creates cube AABBs based on their positions and sizes
  - Implements checkAABBCollision utility function for box intersection tests
- Exports checkCollisions function that:
  - Creates player AABB from current camera position
  - Checks for collisions with each cube in the scene
  - Returns true if any collision is detected
  - Returns false if no collisions are found
- Integrates with controls.js to prevent player movement into objects:
  - Previous position is stored before movement
  - Movement is applied
  - Collision check is performed
  - Position is reverted if collision occurs

### utils.js
- Provides global constants for game parameters:
  - Movement and rotation speeds
  - World size
  - Object properties
  - Colors
  - Collision parameters
- Contains utility functions used across modules
- Centralizes configuration values for easy tweaking
- Provides helper functions for common operations (e.g., random number generation)

## Technical Details

### ES6 Module Integration
- The application uses proper ES6 modules with import/export statements
- Three.js is imported via ES6 import map in index.html, making it available as a module
- Each module explicitly imports its dependencies
- Avoids global variables by using module-scoped variables and explicit exports
- Promotes clean code organization and maintainability

### Rendering Pipeline
1. The WebGLRenderer is created with anti-aliasing for smoother edges
2. Canvas is sized to match the window dimensions (responsive design)
3. Window resize handler updates camera aspect ratio and renderer size
4. The game loop continuously renders the scene at the browser's refresh rate
5. The scene is rendered with the sky blue background color

### User Input System
1. Keyboard events (keydown/keyup) track WASD key states
2. Mouse movement events capture pointer movement when locked
3. Pointer lock is requested on canvas click
4. Input state is maintained in module-scoped variables
5. Camera rotation uses accumulated mouse movement

### Development Environment
- Uses ES6 modules which require a proper web server (not file://)
- A local development server (http-server) is used to avoid CORS issues
- Responsive design ensures proper display across different screen sizes

## Data Flow
1. User input is captured in controls.js
2. main.js game loop calls the update functions of other modules
3. controls.js updates movement variables based on input
4. collision.js checks if movement would cause collisions
5. scene.js updates object positions and camera viewpoint
6. main.js renders the updated scene

This architecture allows for clean separation of concerns while maintaining the ability for modules to communicate through well-defined interfaces (exported functions and variables).

## Implementation Notes for Developers

### Three.js Integration
- Always import Three.js at the top of each module that uses it: `import * as THREE from 'three'`
- The scene, camera, and renderer are created once and shared across modules
- Object creation is centralized in scene.js with helper functions

### Local Development
- Always use a local development server (like http-server) to serve the files
- This prevents CORS issues with ES6 modules
- Run with `http-server -c-1 -o` to disable caching and auto-open the browser

### Browser Compatibility
- The application requires browsers with support for ES6 modules and WebGL
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) should work without issues

The game has no specific objectives at this stage, focusing on foundational mechanics and environment setup.

## 2. Game Concept
The game is a minimalist 3D exploration experience where the player navigates a flat world populated with simple objects. It serves as a starting point for potential future expansions, keeping the initial design very basic.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics
- **Controls:**
  - **Movement:** WASD keys
    - W: Move forward
    - A: Strafe left
    - S: Move backward
    - D: Strafe right
  - **Camera:** Mouse movement to look around (yaw and pitch)
- **Collision Detection:**
  - Simple bounding box checks to prevent the player from passing through objects.

## 4. Environment
- **Ground:**
  - A large, flat plane (e.g., 100x100 units) colored green to represent grass.
- **Objects:**
  - 10 cubes, each 1x1x1 unit, placed at random positions on the ground with varying solid colors (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
- **Lighting:**
  - One directional light to simulate sunlight.
  - One ambient light for even illumination.

## 5. Technical Specifications
- **Engine:** Three.js
- **Camera:** PerspectiveCamera positioned at a fixed height (e.g., 1.5 units) for a first-person view.
- **Renderer:** WebGLRenderer, sized to the browser window.
- **Input Handling:**
  - Keyboard events for movement.
  - Mouse events for camera rotation.
- **Collision Detection:** 2D bounding box checks in the x-z plane (y-axis fixed).
- **Animation Loop:** Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for continuous updates and rendering.

## 6. Art Style
- Basic geometric shapes with solid colors.
- No textures, shadows, or complex materials.

## 7. User Interface
- A simple HTML overlay with text: *"Use WASD to move, mouse to look around."*

## 8. Sound
- None included in this basic version.

## 9. Performance
- Optimized for lightweight performance with a minimal number of objects and no advanced effects.

Detailed Implementation Plan for Basic 3D Exploration Game
This implementation plan provides step-by-step instructions for AI developers to build a basic 3D exploration game using Three.js. Each step is specific, includes actionable instructions, and comes with a test to verify correctness. The focus is on core game features, excluding advanced elements.
Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure
Instructions:
Create a new project directory.

Inside the directory, create these files:
index.html: The main HTML file.

main.js: The JavaScript entry point.

scene.js: For Three.js scene setup.

controls.js: For player input and movement.

collision.js: For collision detection logic.

utils.js: For utility functions and constants.

Link all JavaScript files using ES6 modules (import/export).

Test:
Open index.html in a browser and check the console. No errors related to file loading or module imports should appear.

Step 2: Set Up the HTML and Basic Three.js Renderer
Instructions:
In index.html, add a <canvas> element for rendering.

Add a script tag to load main.js as a module:
html

<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>

In main.js, import functions from other modules.

Initialize a Three.js WebGLRenderer, set its size to the browser window’s dimensions, and attach it to the <canvas>.

Test:
Open index.html in a browser. A black canvas should fill the window, with no console errors.

Step 3: Create the Scene and Camera
Instructions:
In scene.js, create a new Three.js scene.

Add a PerspectiveCamera with:
Field of view: 75 degrees.

Aspect ratio: Window width / height.

Near clipping plane: 0.1.

Far clipping plane: 1000.

Position the camera at (0, 1.5, 0) for a first-person view.

Export the scene and camera for use elsewhere.

Test:
In main.js, add the camera to the scene and render it. The canvas should remain black (no objects yet).

Step 4: Add Lighting
Instructions:
In scene.js, add a directional light (simulating sunlight):
Position: (5, 10, 7).

Intensity: 1.

Add an ambient light with intensity 0.2 for even illumination.

Add both lights to the scene.

Test:
Render the scene. The canvas should still be black (no objects to light up yet).

Step 5: Create the Ground Plane
Instructions:
In scene.js, create a plane geometry (100x100 units).

Apply a basic material with a green color (0x00ff00) for grass.

Position the plane at y=0 and add it to the scene.

Test:
Render the scene. A green plane should be visible. Adjust the camera if needed to confirm.

Step 6: Add Cubes to the Scene
Instructions:
In scene.js, create 10 cubes (1x1x1 units each).

Assign random positions on the ground:
x: -50 to 50.

z: -50 to 50.

y: 0.5 (half cube height).

Give each cube a unique solid color (e.g., 0xff0000 for red).

Add all cubes to the scene.

Test:
Render the scene. 10 colored cubes should appear scattered on the green plane.

Step 7: Implement Basic Movement Controls
Instructions:
In controls.js, add event listeners for WASD keys.

Track key states with variables (e.g., isWPressed).

In main.js, create a game loop to update the camera’s position based on pressed keys (speed: 0.1 units/frame).

Test:
Press W, A, S, D. The camera should move forward, left, backward, and right smoothly.

Step 8: Implement Mouse Look
Instructions:
In controls.js, add mouse movement event listeners.

Update camera rotation based on mouse input.

Limit pitch (up/down) to ±89 degrees to prevent flipping.

Test:
Move the mouse. The camera should rotate left/right and up/down without flipping.

Step 9: Implement Collision Detection
Instructions:
In collision.js, write a function for AABB collision checks (x-z plane) between the camera and cubes.

In main.js, check collisions in the game loop and block camera movement if a collision occurs.

Test:
Move toward a cube. The camera should stop upon contact, not passing through.

Step 10: Add User Interface Instructions
Instructions:
In index.html, add a <div>:
html

<div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; color: white;">Use WASD to move, mouse to look around.</div>

Style it for visibility.

Test:
Open the game. The instruction text should appear clearly on-screen.

Step 11: Optimize and Test Performance
Instructions:
Aim for 60 FPS; monitor frame rate.

Check for performance issues (e.g., excessive draw calls).

Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Test:
Use browser tools to verify FPS and memory usage. The game should run smoothly.

Step 12: Final Testing and Debugging
Instructions:
Playtest thoroughly to find bugs.

Verify WASD and mouse controls work.

Ensure collision detection blocks cube penetration.

Confirm all assets load correctly.

Test:
Play for several minutes, testing all interactions. Fix any issues.

For your basic 3D exploration game built with Three.js, the tech stack consists of the following technologies:
HTML5: This is used to structure the web page and embed the game canvas where the 3D graphics will be displayed.

CSS3: This handles styling for user interface elements, such as instruction text overlays or any other visual components outside the 3D scene.

JavaScript (ES6): The core programming language for the game, where you'll write the logic for movement, camera controls, collision detection, and more. ES6 modules are utilized to keep the code organized in separate files (e.g., main.js, scene.js, controls.js, collision.js, utils.js) for better maintainability.

Three.js: A powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the creation and rendering of 3D graphics in the browser, managing essential components like the scene, camera, lighting, and objects.

WebGL: The underlying technology that Three.js uses to render the 3D graphics efficiently in the browser, leveraging hardware acceleration for smooth performance.

Local Development Server: Tools like Live Server or a Node.js server with Express are recommended to serve the game files during development. This ensures proper loading of assets and simulates a production-like environment, making the development process smoother with features like automatic browser reloading.

This tech stack leverages modern web standards, providing a robust foundation for your game while keeping it accessible across browsers and scalable for future enhancements.
